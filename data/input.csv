"""Donkey Toy is a very special children's music box, combined with the simple but challenging 'Butterfly game'.\n\nYour child selects four animals by tapping tiles and a new song will start. Dancing animals accompany the music.\nEvery animal has its own character represented by a specific musical instrument:\n- Cow: Tuba\n- Horse: Tenor Sax\n- Dog: Music Box\n- Cat: Oboe\n- Goat: Small Bells\n- Sheep: Marimba\n- Pig: Timpani\n- Donkey: Toy Piano\n- Butterfly: Piccolo\n\nThe 'Butterfly game' can be played during playback:\n- Tapping the butterfly causes it to start flapping and fly in the air. After some time the butterfly returns in one of the trees, ready to be tapped again.\n- Points are given for every time the butterfly flaps. Tapping a dancing animal during the flight of the butterfly, increases the number of points given for each flap.\n- The object of the game is to gather as many points as you can. So, let the butterfly flap and tap the other animals as often as possible during its flight.\n- A player needs skills, like selecting the right animal ensemble, tapping the butterfly and the dancing animals as often as possible, and luck: - where does the butterfly land? - how often does it flap during its flight? - how long is the music playing?\n\nThe settings of Donkey Toy allow you to:\n- Set the number of donkeys that will cause the assistant composer to introduce 'weirdness' into the composition.\n- Enable and disable the 'Butterfly game'.\n- Input the name of the player and change player.\n- Reset the scores.\n- Set different MIDI Out channels for every track. When you have another  app or MIDI sound module capable of processing incoming MIDI data you can easily enhance the sounds.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDonkey Toy is a spin-off of YouCompose.\n\nYouCompose offers a powerful assistant composer to users who want to compose complex musical compositions. YouCompose is also capable of composing a complete 3 or 4 movement symphony al by itself. This assistant composer, also present in Donkey Toy is responsible for all its musical content. Every time a child taps four animal-tiles a new musical composition is created. That is why every tune played is unique and Donkey Toy will never repeat itself.\nThe compositions created in Donkey Toy all have a classical small ternary form."""

"TOAG is an adaptation of the ancient game of Ishido set in Anglo-Saxon style.  Following Anglo-Saxon traditional sorcery you will learn to exercise your wiglung to anticipate and foresee how best to arrange the runes in order to optimize your weird (fate).  This game has puzzled the minds of many for hundreds of years.  Pit your wits against the fates and see if you are clever enough to solve the mysteries of the runes.\n\nIn the training version you will be able to undo moves and receive hints where to place runes.  Such actions erase all gains you have made.  Your score will reset as will any bonus accumulators you\u2019ve earned.  So, use them wisely.  This version of the game is meant to allow you, at a cost, to explore various alternatives and teach you how to look ahead.  Taking in all the details that surround you and foreseeing probabilities and potential is the bread and butter of Anglo-Saxon sorcery.  Anglo-Sax sorcerers do not predict the future, they see the potential of all futures that could be and then choose and influence the one they want the most to occur.\n\nYou earn sorcery points by making 4 way connections.  These are the most difficult to make happen, however, fortune favors the lucky just the same.  Earn enough sorcery points with the classic game to unlock the Apprentice and Mastery versions.\nGood luck young sorcerer.\n\nIt was believed that TOAG or Ishido was a means to divine the future.  A game of chance that also offered a glimpse of future events.  It teaches us that if we can perceive the possibilities before us we can better prepare for them in the future.  TOAG (Ishido) was a training tool for ancient prophets who sought to learn the timely craft of seeing into the future.\n\nTHE RULES\nThere are 72 tiles, two of each combination of six colors and six icons. For example, there is 2 Red Feathers, 2 Blue Feathers, 2 Green Feathers, 2 White Feathers, 2 Purple Feathers, and 2 Yellow Feathers.  There are 5 other icons with the same color configuration making a total of 72 tiles.  At the start of the game six tiles are placed on the board automatically which are drawn from the bag of tiles after they have been shuffled.  To place an additional tile on the board, you must match at least one adjacent tile according to the restrictions listed below.  Each time you place a tile a random tile is drawn from the bag of tiles.  You play until either you can no longer place a tile on the board or you have emptied your bag of 72 tiles.\n\nTo match a single tile, you must match either the color or shape.\n\nTo match two tiles, you must match one shape and one color.\n\nTo match three tiles, you must match two colors and one shape OR two shapes and one color.\n\nTo match four tiles, you must match two colors and two shapes.\n\nWhen placing a tile you must consider those tiles which are adjacent to the location you want to place the tile at.  You can not place a tile on top of a tile.  If the space you want to place the tile at has 3 adjacent tiles you must match all three according to the restrictions listed above and so on.  As you get further along in the game placing tiles will become increasingly more difficult.  The strategy of the game is understanding how many colors of which tiles have already been drawn and which still remain in the bag.  By carefully placing key tiles on the board you can plan for the arrival of certain tiles to score greater points.  The more tiles you match with each placement of a tile the more points you will be awarded.\n\nTiles placed on the interior (lighter) squares score points when placed according to the number of adjacent tiles that they match.  Tiles placed outside the interior award no points (Traveling the interior of the board is a step of progress and risk, walking only at its perimeter is the safe mans journey which ultimately takes you in circles)."

"A more human chess engine.\n\nPrimus is an entirely original, modern chess engine specifically designed for the intermediate player (up to 2000 Elo). It has been carefully tuned to play less like a machine and more like a human. At lower levels, it makes blunders of a straightforward kind that are easy to spot, but at higher levels more careful play is required to take advantage of more subtle tactical and even strategic errors. At its highest levels, Primus plays at around 2000 Elo, but even at the very highest levels, it still has occasional simulated lapses of concentration.\n\nThe engine was conceived out of frustration with the overwhelming tactical strength of modern chess engines. Most modern chess engines are so tactically strong that extremely careful defensive and anti-computer play is required to make any progress; in other words, it\'s nothing like playing a human. We wanted to create an engine that allows for a more human, strategic style of play where there\'s room to take advantage of the occasional blunder.\n\nWe\'ve included a mate puzzle generator to create an almost infinite variety of checkmate puzzles that allow you to sharpen your chess instincts, and multiplayer modes that allow you to use your device as a virtual chessboard, or play via bluetooth or wireless with a local opponent.\n\nWe\'ve also added a ""Time Control"" mode, to allow you to play using standard chess time controls, rather than a predefined difficulty level.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Mate puzzle generator - an almost infinite number of puzzles.\n- Two player mode over Bluetooth / Lan.\n- Tabletop mode so you can use your device as a virtual chessboard.\n- Various different boards, pieces and graphical options.\n- Support for all skill levels from total novice to expert.\n- Supports all orientations, so you can make full use of your iPad Smart Case or stand.\n- Supports multitasking, so you can follow along with videos/ebooks.\n- Focus mode, to hide the UI so you can focus on the board.\n- Puzzles and practice levels, so you can practice your endgames or play some interesting challenge levels.\n- Mini-tournament mode - a six-game mini tournament mode for the more serious player.\n- Elo rating estimation from your game results."

"""The aim of the game is to file all foundation piles (A) and play so many rounds as possible. \nEvery pile in the game is to be laid alternately with a red and black card. \nTo begin there are four decks with 10 cards (C).

The final picture shows 8 turned kings. \n\nIn addition, there are 2 auxiliary packages (B) which begin in each case with a black king and with a red king. On them you can lay  Q, J, 10, 9 . . . 3, 2.\n\nThe game goes on, while one turns the talon (D) card for card. Every card is to be checked whether it fits on an ace foundation piles (A) (with subsequent cards) or on a king's piles (B) (with subsequent cards). The king's piles (B) let themselves put down in the course of the game often card for card on an ace foundation pile (A). Then the free-become king's place again may be booked with a king. Every turned card of the talon which cannot be used is filed openly on the pile (E). If all cards are turned, the pile (E) becomes the talon (D) again - this may often happen arbitrarily. \n\nFor every laid card you get points.

"Locked and Loaded...\n\nListen, jewels and candy are cool and all \u2014 but they got nothing on guns, baby! This ain\'t your grandma\'s puzzle game (no offense, grandma). \n\nThis is ""2048 Guns"". \n\nSet in the not-so-distant dystopian future of 2048 (as you may have already guessed), you are tasked with utilizing your own cunning and well-earned penchant for puzzle match games to stockpile and unlock your way to the peak of your arsenal. \n\nThe concept of this fast-paced and addictive puzzler is simple enough.  Swipe in any direction and merge tiles of the same variety. Two of the same creates an entirely new tile of higher tier. But be careful: each ineffective swipe leads to a brand new tier 1 tile being placed on the board.  This might serve you well or it might not \u2014 it\'s all about how you choose to tackle it. Your board only has a finite number of slots, so make sure you don\'t let it get too cluttered. It\'s your job to manage the board accordingly. Be strategic in your tile-swiping ways and reap the glory of an awesome arsenal of wickedly-designed makeshift guns. Swipe mindlessly and without tact and you\'ll be left with a deadlocked board. Remember: the key here is to be locked and loaded, not deadlocked. \n\nScale your way up from lowly bullets, to pistols, to machine guns, and all the steel-packing heat in between. Don\'t get too swept up in strategy though: we\'ve added a couple tools along the way to help you on your quest to firearm dominance. But don\'t let that fool you either. Just like the slots on your board, these too, are limited. skillfulness is what will ultimately decide your fate. You either live by the gun or die by the gun. \n\nSo what are you waiting for? Try ""2048 Guns"" and see what your top gun will be!"

"""We bet you could not conquer first 100 stages in one month. Can you rise to this challenge?\n\nAnimal Wow originates from the classic play of 5 ball lines puzzle, with the additional features of challenging mission, magic boosters and attractive rewards. In the game, players complete levels by moving colored pieces of animals on a game board to make a line of five or more of the same color, eliminating those animals from the board and replaced with new ones, which could potentially create further lines. Boards have various goals that must be completed within a fixed number of moves, such as a certain score or collecting a specific number of a type of animals. \n\n- Burning brain: there may be only one or two correct strategy of elimination in every stage. Careful consideration is a mandotory for every click. if the first step is wrong, \nperhaps you cannot conquer the whole stage.\n\n- Powerful Boosters: magic tools act as power-ups with larger board-clearing abilities to help complete the missions when in trouble. Players can exchange boosters by earning golden coins with their own high intelligence.\n\n- Abundant stages: there are 100(to be continued) different levels provided, each level has its own initial difficulty and task challenges.\n\n- Cute Style: here we have bunnies, birds, pigs, frogs and bears and many other cute animals instead of normal balls in your pocket. These adorable puppies make it welcome for players of all ages.\n\nAnimalWow is an innovative game originating from all the Nutty Studio's talent. Somewhere it is like Candy Crush as a match-three puzzle, somewhere it's like Commands&Colors as a SLG game.\n\n**************************\nIf you are lucky enough to finish the 100 stages' challenge, please make a screenshot and contact us by: \n\nSupport email: nuttystudio8@gmail.com\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/flymonkeykings\nWechat Group: search 'wanlehuo'\nQQ Group: 261670109"""

"""Chess Combat is a board game for two players. It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\nDuring the game, the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage and wins more often than Black in tournament games."""

En el caso de que haya mus, cada jugador se descarta de las cartas que quiera, una como m\xednimo y obtendr\xe1 de vuelta otras nuevas. Si alg\xfan jugador no quiere mus, inmediatamente se corta la ronda de mus y se pasa directamente a jugar.\n\nUna vez que se corta el mus, se comienza a jugar cada uno de los cuatro ""lances"" de los que consta el juego. Estos lances son: ""grande"", ""chica"", ""pares"" y ""juego"".\n\nEn cada lance, comienza hablando el jugador mano, pudiendo ""envidar"" (apostar) o ""pasar"" y que hable el siguiente jugador. La apuesta puede ser desde 2 (envido) hasta 30 (\xf3rdago). La otra pareja de jugadores decidir\xe1 si acepta la apuesta (se ven), sube la apuesta desde 2 (subo 2) hasta 30 (\xf3rdago) o rechaza la apuesta, ganando un punto el equipo que comenz\xf3 la apuesta.\n\nEste proceso se repite con los cuatro lances, una vez terminados, todos los jugadores muestran sus cartas y se realiza el tanteo.

Tener juego significa que el valor de las cartas de la mano sume: 31 (\u201cla una\u201d), 32, 40, 37, 36, 35, 34 o 33 (el peor juego).\nPunto: En caso de no tener juego ning\xfan jugador se decide qui\xe9n se acerca m\xe1s a 30 con el valor de sus cartas.\n\nTanteo\nUna vez acabados los envites a los cuatro lances, y en caso de que el juego no se haya terminado antes por un ""\xf3rdago"" o por haber llegado una pareja a 30 (vaca), se procede a la fase de puntuaci\xf3n de los envites pendientes, as\xed como los premios adicionales que pueden tener algunas jugadas.\n\nEn caso de empate en alg\xfan lance, gana el jugador mano o m\xe1s pr\xf3ximo a la mano seg\xfan el orden de juego.\n\nValor de las cartas de mayor a menor: \nTRES o REY, 11 o Caballo, 10 o Sota, 7, 6, 5, 4, DOS o AS.

Esto equivale a jugar con 8 REYES y 8 ASES. \n\nEl valor de las cartas de cualquier palo ser\xe1 el siguiente: \nEl REY, TRES, CABLLO Y SOTA valen 10 puntos. \nEl resto de cartas su valor natural indicado en la carta. \nLos DOSES y los ASES valen 1 punto."

"""Chess is a two player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid called chessboard.\n\t\t\tEach player begins the game with 16 pieces : one king , one queen, two rooks, two Knights two biships and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types move differently. The objective is to  checkmate your opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting their own. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by voluntary resignation by the opponent, which typically occurs when too many pieces are lost , or if checkmate appears unavoidable. A game may also result in a draw in several ways, where neither player wins."""

"Mind Twist is an easy to play strategic game for the Apple iPad. The goal is to remove all, or as may as possible, of the colored tiles on the playing field. Tiles that are surrounded (top, bottom, left, right) by one or more tiles with the same color, can be removed by touching any tile in the equal colored group. \nThe more tiles of the same color you manage to remove at once, the more points you get. \nTwist your iPad to solve the game or to get a higher score! On rotation, the tiles ""fall"" down to the new bottom side of the playing field - according to the ""gravity"". Using this feature is important, because you achieve new layouts of the tiles to remove - and possibly get a higher score. The game is over, when all tiles are removed or no tiles could be removed anymore."

"American roulette is unique. Only United States and CANADA have this version of the game, as people all over the world play European Roulette because of its known odd edge.\n\n                 The expected value is:\n                 \u22121\xd737\u204438 + 35\xd71\u204438 = \u22120.0526 (5.26% house edge)\n                 For European roulette, a single number wins 1\u204437 and loses 36\u204437:\n                 \u22121\xd736\u204437 + 35\xd71/37 = \u22120.0270 (2.70% house edge)\n\nAmerican roulette shares the same rules with European Roulette. However, it has completely different layout of the wheel plus a double zero. Double zeroes helped casinos earn more profits and also made players lose a larger sum of money at a faster pace.

Departed is a unique cross between a puzzle and strategy, designed with engaging visuals.\n\nYou play a robot that must escape through a series of complicated mazes by teleporting and floor hopping around 3D dimensional and multi floored levels to reach the end. It\u2019s like 3D chess\u2026only more fun!\n\nDeparted is unlike any game available on the App Store as it challenges your brain in an enjoyable and exciting way. The best part is that Departed is suitable for all ages. \n\nBut what makes Departed truly revolutionary is the brand new multiplayer mode where you can race or play tag against your friends or challenge someone else from around the world. But unlike most mobile games, this experience is more like a game console, as you play against your opponent live. No more need to take your move and wait days for them to respond (or forget they were playing), you get instant gratification. What\u2019s even more enjoyable is using a power-up to make your opponent move like a snail or freeze them in time and watching them struggle in \u2018real-time\u2019.\n\nFeatures:\n\t\u25aa\tArcade mode with 144 levels (new levels coming soon)\n\t\u25aa\tStory mode coming soon\n\t\u25aa\tMultiplayer modes - race and tag (capture the flag coming soon)\n\t\u25aa\tFull support for leaderboards and achievements\n\t\u25aa\tIn app purchases lets you buy power-ups for multiplayer mode\n\nDeparted was created by Incket Interactive, a small indie developer team of two from Australia.

As many fans have imported the board game we\u2019ve included the English language into the app as a fan service. Enjoy!\n\nScotland Yard Master is the new development in the world-famous classic board game Scotland Yard, which was named Game of the Year in 1983. \n\nTogether with the board game, this app offers a completely new and even more exciting way to play. The detectives are on the cutting edge of technology and even hotter on the heels of Mr X. They will find all the important information in the digital control centre: Which modes of transport has Mr X travelled by so far? When will he show himself again? What special actions can be used? You can select mobile phone tracking, for example, and point the smartphone or tablet\u2019s camera at the four radio masts on the game board. Green, yellow or red radio waves will indicate whether or not Mr X is nearby. You can also question witnesses at important buildings across the city. The camera comes into play again, showing Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in 3D. Witnesses will reveal whether Mr X is or has recently been there. \n\nFurthermore, the detectives can determine his possible locations by analysing his previous moves, or by measuring the distance between Mr X and the nearest radio mast. But if you think you\u2019ve already got Mr X in the bag, you can think again. With his new escape option, the helicopter, he\u2019s as cunning as ever. He can also win the game by reaching two of five pre-determined rendezvous points.\n\nThe innovative combination of the classic board game and digital gaming fun guarantees an engrossing experience for the whole family!"

Get this sweet and addictive game and transport them all!\n\nFEATURES:\n- 50 challenging levels\n- 8 different buses\n- 5 station upgrades\n- Many zone types\n\nSTRATEGY TIPS:\n- UNDERSTANDING THE CITY\nFrom the very first moment of the level you should watch the buildings! The taller building you are looking at, the bigger potential it has! Taller buildings offer more passengers. So your first line should be going through these huge buildings!\n\n- CASH UNDERSTANDING\nYou can\xb4t win without cash. You will need a lot of cash in advanced levels! Keep reading\u2026\n\n- CHOOSING CORRECT STARTING LINE\nAs stated you should explore the city at the beggining. Start your first line on the place where there are a lot of bigger buildings! Bigger buildings mean a lot of potencial lost passengers (stolen by the taxi). This is really important to think about!\n\n- UPGRADING THE STATIONS\nImagine you have bought a bus with a small capacity. So there is no sense to upgrade the stations to their maximum while you are saving money for better buses! Station upgrades are expensive! Upgrade the stations after buying a new bus. Immediately, if possible.\n\n- SELLING OLD VEHICLES\nThe best strategy is to sell your buses after they have reached their final station. Let the buses serve all passengers on their line. Then sell them before reaching their depot."

The choice is yours!\n\nThe ultimate goal of My Planet is to grow a happy and thriving population.

For optimal vegetation and thus population growth, you must try to keep your Sun and Water levels in the sweet spot, indicated by your Sun and Water meters being 50% full. If you have too much sunlight, vegetation will dry up and your people will die. If you have too little sunlight, vegetation cannot grow and your people will starve. Same concept with water.

"The Eightfold Way Game is a set of 360 puzzles. The task is simple: the board of the game has to be completely covered by the player. The puzzles are gradually becoming more and more difficult and each of them has only one solution. The player (starting from the beginner level, through the advanced, master and grandmaster levels), can reach the champion level as a real world-class puzzle solver.\nIn comparing the Eightfold game to a (thus far) more famous Hungarian puzzle, Rubik\u2019s cube, we would note that in an important way, the two puzzles are polar opposites. Rubik\u2019s cube has taught millions of people the following lesson: Presented with an extremely difficult task that you are highly unlikely to be able even to approach solving on your own, if you are willing to learn a few tricks, you will not only be able to accomplish the task, but you will enjoy doing it, and you will earn respect. That is a lesson of that belongs to the past two centuries, when expert knowledge was the key to success and prosperity.\nHowever, in the twenty-first century, the key to prosperity is convertible knowledge. Solving the puzzles of the Eightfold game requires this kind of knowledge, and it develops it by training mental flexibility. Even the most difficult of the eightfold puzzles can be solved without any specific knowledge; only mental flexibility is needed.\nThe Eightfold Way game has proved quite addictive and enjoyable for a wide variety of individuals, from curious five-year-olds to otherwise bored adolescents to adults of all ages and abilities. We have realized that even five-year-olds could enjoy the game, and after a brief explanation and a few general strategic hints, they can solve at least the puzzles at the beginner level. On the other hand in spite of their apparent simplicity, the grandmaster and champion level puzzles have delivered a real challenge even for world-class puzzle solvers.\nThe application is based on the book: \u201cThe Eightfold Way, Improvement of the mental flexibility\u201d by L\xe1szl\xf3 M\xe9r\u0151.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nA Nyolcr\xe9t\u0171 \xdat j\xe1t\xe9k egy 360 feladv\xe1nyt tartalmaz\xf3 puzzle sorozat.
